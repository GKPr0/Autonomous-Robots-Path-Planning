matploblib=3.1.0

<h4>Assigment 0:</h4>
-> Python Intro (classes, dict, numpy)

<h4>Assigment 1:</h4>
-> BFS and DFS algorithms 

<h4>Assigment 2:</h4>
-> A* implemented on simple grid world, with simple counting distance to goal location as heuristic function

<h4>Assigment 3:</h4>
-> A* algorithm same as in previous assignment, but applied to New York map

<h4>Assigment 4:</h4>
-> Advanced A* algorithm focused on having admissible and consistent heuristic, so it will find the most optimal way to goal.
